# Widgetario Kubernetes Hackathon Project

## üì¶ Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a multi-component application called *Widgetario* on Kubernetes. It covers essential Kubernetes concepts such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Ephemeral and Persistent Storage using `emptyDir` and StatefulSets.

This submission includes **Parts 1 to 5** of the lab work.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

All YAML files are placed at the root level and named clearly to indicate their role:

| File                           | Purpose                                      |

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Deploy multi-service apps using Kubernetes              
- Use Services for inter-component communication                             
- Apply ConfigMaps and Secrets for secure configuration                             
- Implement `emptyDir` (ephemeral) and PVC-based storage for persistence              
- Replace stateless DB deployments with StatefulSets
- Build resilience using replicas and readiness/liveness probes
